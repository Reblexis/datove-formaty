Again we have managed to do quite a bit of work during the practicals, so everyone contributed.
Then it was a matter of who said that they are going to finish up some specific task, then done so, shared it with other people so that the others could check it and fix some potential issues.
We tried to split the work evenly and so that everyone would get a feel for all the parts of the homework.
